# RobotFramework_DemoProject

## Overview
RobotFramework_DemoProject is a demonstration project showcasing the usage of Robot Framework for web automation. This project emphasizes both web and mobile automation capabilities provided by Robot Framework.

## Technologies Used
- [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/): A generic open-source automation framework for acceptance testing and robotic process automation (RPA).
- [SeleniumLibrary](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html): A web testing library for Robot Framework that utilizes the Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary): A library for Robot Framework that provides keywords to interact with mobile apps using Appium.

## Features
### Web Automation
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Execute tests across different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using SeleniumLibrary's browser support.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a structured approach to designing test automation by utilizing the Page Object Model for better maintenance and scalability.
- **Keyword-Driven Testing:** Write tests in a keyword-driven format, making them more readable and easier to maintain.

### Mobile Automation
- **Mobile App Testing:** Utilize the AppiumLibrary to automate tests on mobile applications, supporting both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Device Farm Integration:** Scale mobile tests by integrating with device farms such as AWS Device Farm or Sauce Labs for parallel execution across various devices and platforms.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Robot Framework and necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
